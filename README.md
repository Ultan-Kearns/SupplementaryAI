## Produced as part of the GMIT 4th Year Module: Artificial Intelligence 
### Under the supervision of Dr. John Healy

## Introduction to Project

## Parsing
To parse the training data I thought it was a good idea to let the user decide the number of Ngrams in the Runner class and then I used the user specified ngrams to break each language string in the training data up into the specified size.
## Hashing

## Neural Network Topology

### Activation Functions
### Number of Neurons
### Error Rate
## Extras
